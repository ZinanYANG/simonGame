# simonGame
i am building a game that is modeled off the game Simon , the way it works is that u can press any key to start and it'll show u a tile that u have to click on , as u go from level to level , the patterns get more and more complicated , at some point u will get screwed up and u will get notified "u got it wrong " and u have to press any key to start over
